		<h1>Week 1 - Introduction to Multimedia</h1>
		
		<h2>IL activity: Choosing and preparing your topic</h2>
		
		<section id="task1IL">
		<h3>Task 1: Choosing your topic</h3>
		<p>For my first task, I went through the DMIS curriculum from the past 2 years and made a list of the topics I was interested in pursuing for my project. After ranking and narrowing them down, I considered the audience for each topic and how they would interact with and benefit from the website.</p>
		<p>Artificial Intelligence – How AI is impacting the Film and TV industry</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Audience: Designers and creatives could benefit from learning about the technologies behind and AI, how it can aid in creation and its detriments</li>
			<li>This is a relevant topic as discussions are occurring about developing technologies and the strikes and how these tools have the potential to aid or threaten jobs</li>
		</ul>
		<p>VR/AR - New uses of relevant technology in the performing arts</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Audience: Theatre groups could learn more about new and innovative ways to enhance their art</li>
		</ul>
		<p>3D Modelling – How models are being used in the medical field, specifically in Psychology/Neuroscience</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Audience: Students and researchers could benefit from learning more about new technologies that can help in making new discoveries and training</li>
			<li>This is something that many people in the field already work with, so might not be as useful to them</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Digitisation and Archiving – How performing arts are being brought to audiences through the digital sphere</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Audience: Theatre companies would be able to learn the importance of making performing arts accessible to people at home</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Information Governance – Basics of information governance and security for new companies</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Audience: New companies, small businesses, and startups could have a website that takes them through the step-by-step process of the IG framework</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Games and Education – How primary school teachers use learning games to teach kids maths</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Audience: Teachers could learn about new resources to use for their students</li>
		</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task2IL">
		<h3>Task 2: Explore the scope of the topic and narrow down the focus</h3>
		<p>Questions I'm aiming to answer:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How is AI being used in the Film & TV industry?</li>
			<li>What new technologies are threatening jobs in the industry?</li>
			<li>How can AI be beneficial to creators and speed up processes?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To narrow down my scope of AI use in Film and TV, I started my search with Google Scholar. 
		I didn't have much luck searching things like "Impact of AI in Film and TV," so using the Boolean operators under advanced search, I looked for resources with the following terms: AI, Film Industry dated after 2015 for more recent and accurate results. 
		One paper I found was <a href="https://mediarep.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/fa1f16f3-e723-4250-914f-b5bf3a5ffc2f/content">“Ghost in the (Hollywood) machine: Emergent applications of artificial intelligence in the film industry”</a> by Pei-Sze Chow. 
		From there, I looked at more recent articles which cited this paper and the sources cited within the paper itself. 
		All of the resources I found useful, I stored in my <a href="mada-metadata_justification_table.xlsx">Metadata and Justification Table excel spreadsheet.</a>
		I found that I could narrow down my topic even further if I wanted to and look at AI used for commercial viability and green lighting productions, generative AI used in making films, new AI potentially threatening jobs, like those that create background actors or write scripts.
		I also decided I would focus on film, but include elements of media/TV if relevant for the user.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task3IL">
		<h3>Task 3: Keeping track of your resources</h3>
		<p>For this task, I downloaded the Metadata and Justification Table excel spreadsheet (which I went back and used in the previous task) and created folders for documents, sounds, videos, images, etc. that I would store during this process. Keeping track of these items is not only essential for staying organised, but for remembering where information is sourced from.</p>

		<h2>Lab activity: Re-acquainting yourself with HTML</h2>
		
		<section id="task1LAB">
		<h3>Task 1: Setting up your file structure</h3>
		<p>Using the MAD(A) Template file system and HTML documents along with the guides on Moodle, I was able to set up a file structure for this project. I made sure to use hyphens and underscores to separate words and lowercase letters when naming files.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task2LAB">
		<h3>Task 2: Review of HTML</h3>
		<p>To brush up on my HTML knowledge, I consulted the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp">W3Schools Guide</a> and the MAD(A) project templates. I remember quite a bit, as I have prior experience with HTML, so it was easy to jump back in.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task3LAB">
		<h3>Task 3: Keeping track of your resources</h3>
		<p>I worked on setting up all of my files to store my Lab and Independent Learning activities in along with an index.</p>
