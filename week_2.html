		<h1>Week 2 - Principles of Design</h1>
		
		<h2>IL activity: Defining your Audience</h2>
		
		<section id="task1IL">
		<h3>Task 1: Identifying your audience(s)</h3>
		<p><b>Does the focus of your topic lend itself to particular audiences? What makes you think this?</b> I think with the SAG-AFTRA strikes, more and more people are becoming curious about the uses of AI in Film.
		Not only will my audience consist of people within the industry looking to learn more about AI and how it affects their jobs, but film enthusiasts interested in the uses of AI technology.</p>
		<p><b>Whether you want to focus on a broad or narrow audience?</b> I would like to focus on a broader audience, so information can be accessible to a wider demographics and people who aren't as knowledgeable about the topic.
		My website is not for people who are experts in AI, rather those looking to learn more about its general uses.</p>
		<p><b>Whether the audience is likely to have pre-existing expectations about the topic?</b> People working with AI in the film industry or those directly affected by it would probably have pre-existing expectations.
		Especially with the strikes, there is more of a negative outlook towards the technology. 
		However, because of media's portrayal of AI in Film/TV/Streaming (eg. Black Mirror) larger audiences also have perceptions about the tools and their ramifications.</p>
		<p><b>What types of audience do you have regular access to in order to facilitate user testing?</b> Students, people studying Film/TV, people who watch/consume/make different types of media.</p>
				
		<table class="center">
 			<tr> 
  		 		<td><b><center>Audience Characteristic</center></b></td>
				<td><b><center>Rationale</center></b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr> 
    			<td>Age</td>
    			<td>I will be writing my project for people (likely teenagers and older), as the topic of AI is not something younger audiences can fully grasp.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Gender</td>
    			<td>Any. The subject of AI in Film is not limited or related to gender.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Language proficiency</td>
    			<td>This website will assume that the audience is proficient in English. This is the main language used across the industry and the one I, the developer, am proficient in. 
    			If my website were to grow, I could look into including translations on my website.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Education level</td>
    			<td>Similar to age, most of the audience will be older, so they likely have completed school and/or higher education to grasp the concepts.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Attitude towards writer or organisation</td>
    			<td>I'm anticipating that the audience will be hesitant towards AI because of the strikes,
    			and this website will explore the ways it is being used in media and the ramifications of it.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Knowledge of the topic</td>
    			<td>The website will be more surface-level knowledge and facts for people wanting to learn more, so all the information will be quite accessible. 
    			I am under the assumption that the majority of my audience won't be knowledgeable about the topic, as they are seeking out an overview on AI and its uses.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Audience action</td>
    			<td>I think the audience will want to continue gathering more information and either want to apply AI to their own projects or fight against it.
    			It will also allow them to have a level of knowledge high enough to take part in conversations surrounding AI in the industry.</td>

		<h3>Task 2: Building audience personas</h3>
		<p>Below I have included a few different audience personas for people who may visit my website. I created avatars on the website <a href="https://avatarmaker.com/">Avatar Maker.</a></p>

		<h3>Task 3: Exploring the audience needs in relation to design</h3>
		<p><b>UX Activity - Writing user experiences</b></p>
		<p>User story: "As a student looking to learn more about how AI can help me in creating a short film, I want to find a list of software that I can use in my own creations, so that I can stay up-to-date with trending AI technologies and find something to aid in my creation process."</p>
		<p>Acceptance criteria example: "It is done when the user knows what AI technologies are being used to create/help film production."</p>
		<p>User story: "As a producer looking to see if my film has commercial viability, I want to find more information on recent AI technologies, so that I can speed up and improve this process."</p>
		<p>Acceptance criteria example: "It is done when the user knows about how AI can help in predicting box office performance."</p>
		<p><b>UX Activity - User need statements</b></p>
		<p>User: Will, a YouTuber and book enthusiast | Need: To make a YouTube intro without learning how to use video/animation software | Insight/goal: Improve videos and gain followers</p>
		<p>Need statement: Will, a YouTuber and book enthusiast, needs to make a YouTube intro without learning how to use video/animation software in order to improve his videos and gain followers.</p>
		<p>Development statement: A user needs a list of AI software that can be used to generate video when a prompt is typed in.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task3IL">
		<h3>Task 4: Updating your portfolio</h3>
		<p>For my project, focusing on the use of AI in the film industry, I decided to cater to an audience with less knowledge of AI tools, looking to learn more about these technologies. 
		Through exploring personas and defining my audience, I realised that the unique experience my website is offering is a hub of the most recent and unbiased information on AI technologies in film.
		With the recent SAG-AFTRA strikes, people are seeking out a place to educate themselves on these topics.
		This helped me to begin thinking of how I would want to structure my website and the types of multimedia elements I would like to include in my design.
		I was truly able to get into the mind of my audience and learn more about user experience in the process.</p>
		</section>
		
		<h2>Lab activity: Establishing ideas for your design</h2>
		
		<section id="task1LAB">
		<h3>Task 1: Identify and evaluate websites</h3>
		<p>Website 1 - <a href="https://www.hrodc.com/">HRDOC</a></p>
		<p>The audience for this page is prospective postgraduate students, and while there is a lot of information, it is not presented in a user-friendly way. 
		There is contact information and links to their social media, but it is difficult to locate and there is no direct means of feedback and interactivity. 
		The colours on the website are not very appealing and the experience is not user-friendly. 
		The purpose of the website is to produce information on a post-graduate institute and the courses and diplomas they offer, but information is crowded and there is a lack of structure. 
		No images of the institute have been included on the homepage.</p>
		<p>Website 2 - <a href="https://designmuseum.org/">Design Museum</a></p>
		<p>This is a website dedicated to the Design Museum, located in London. 
		The website is interactive, easy to use, balanced, and clearly states what people should click on depending on what they are looking for (eg. visiting, becoming a member, signing up for newsletters, following social media, etc.).
		There are many images and bold colours used on the website, similar to what kind of things would be in the museum.
		This website has many features, including pop-up menus, links to more information, and cohesive fonts and themes.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task2LAB">
		<h3>Task 2: Consider your audience</h3>
		<p>The HRDOC website is a great example of elements I won't want to include in my website, as it is crowded and difficult to find information. 
		While I love the Design Museum website, I think mine will be structured much differently.
		Where their website is encouraging people to come visit and take part in different activities and exhibits, mine is going to be a hub of information and learning.
		I think I will have less pictures on my home page and more text, but I do like the interactive buttons and font choices made by the Design Museum.
		Additionally, I will create a menu at the top similar to the one on the Design Museum website. However, I might include a navigation bar with everything instead of one you have to click on to see.
		If I was someone looking to learn about the basics of AI in the film industry, it would be great to have a website presenting information about different topics in an easy-to-read and accessible manner.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task3LAB">
		<h3>Task 3: Begin a moodboard of design ideas</h3>
		<img src="images/moodboard-01.png" class="center" alt="moodboard of design concept" width="800" height="550">
		<p>To create my moodboard, I used <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva.</a> I wanted to create a cohesive colour scheme with graphics and fonts reflecting my topic of choice.
		I want my website to be interactive, colourful, grabbing the user's attention and making it easy to find more information on what they are looking for.
		I want informational sounds and video of examples of AI, along with images that match the website's concept.
		Despite having many negative connotations in the industry, I also want to convey the technological advancements in AI that aid artists in their work.
		The website will be an informative place, explaining the pros and cons of AI and its uses.
		I think it would be cool to contrast some "retro" graphics with the modern applications of AI.
		I want a hierarchical, web-linked structure to my website, so users can investigate the topics of AI in scriptwriting, in green lighting scripts/commercial viability, in VFX/editing, and the relationship between AI and actors.
		Finally, I will use darker text, likely black, against a light background, so it can easily be read.
		Creating this moodboard definitely helped me get more of a vision for my project.</p>
