		<h1>Week 3 - Visual Design, Storytelling and Making a Point</h1>
		
		<h2>IL activity: Establish your narrative and structure</h2>
		
		<section id="task1IL">
		<h3>Task 1: Identify key narrative points and create a plan</h3>
		<p><b>Readings completed:</b></p>
		<p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/storytelling-elements-31b2a6a7e373">Elements of Good Story Telling</a> by Ankit Passi</p>
		<p>Remember that design is the process of telling a story. Elements of storytelling include the plot, characters, theme, dialogue, melody, decor, spectacle, and conclusion.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/storytelling">Storytelling</a> by the Interaction Design Foundation</p>
		<p>For designers, storytelling allows them to get inside the mind of users and emotionally connect to them. Always consider the what, the who, and the how.</p>
		<p>My website will not be teaching people how to use AI or the complexities of it, but rather a hub of information and resources about relevant AI technologies in the Film industry and what people are using today.
		Users will learn potential new ways to do things and develop knowledge.
		I plan on creating a hierarchical site with different topics and more information on each.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task2IL">
		<h3>Task 2: Incorporate the narrative plan into your portfolio</h3>
		<p><img src="images/narrative.png" class="narrative" alt="website narrative" width="650" height="300">
		For my website, I will be using a hierarchical, web-linked structure, where users first interact with a homepage. 
		Instead of a linear model, I want to sort my content into silos to increase search engine optimisation and user retention.
		There will be a menu on top with different navigation links, such as contact information, about us (information about my "organisation"), and a drop-down menu with links to different types of AI in the Film industry.
		I want to have interactive elements, so users have the ability to learn more through video, audio, images, etc., leave feedback, and access external resources as well.
		The main topics I want to create pages on are AI in scriptwriting, AI in green lighting scripts/commercial viability, AI in VFX/editing, and AI and actors.
		Each section will contain information for beginners or people newer to learning about AI and how they can learn more/find their own software to use.
		I want my website to tell a story about AI and how it effects the world today in the creative industries, both in a positive and negative manner.
		Ethical considerations and challenges will also be considered.
		There will be a cohesive colour scheme (as pictured above), use of fonts, and layout throughout each of the pages.
		I want to combine both futuristic elements that people associate with AI and retro colours and graphics to add to the decour.</p>
