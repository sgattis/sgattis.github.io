		<p>My website will not be teaching people how to use AI or the complexities of it, but rather a hub of information and resources about relevant AI technologies in the Film industry and what people are using today.
		Users will learn potential new ways to do things and develop knowledge.
		I plan on creating a hierarchical site with different topics and more information on each.</p>
