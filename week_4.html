		<h3>Task 1: Review of CSS</h3>
		<p>I used the resources provided to refresh my knowledge on CSS and gain inspiration on how I want my website to look. Considering fonts, I want to use mostly sans-serif (for a modern and minimalistic look) and monospace (to create a mechanical look).
		These fit the aesthetic I am going for on my page, while presenting information in a clear, appealing way that is easy for users to read. 
		While I have a foundation of knowledge on CSS basics, I did take note of elements I want to include in my design, such as the sticky position (for menus/titles) and floating images.
		I found the information on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">w3schools'</a> website to be the most beneficial and useful for my project.</p>

		<h2>Lab activity: Using CSS</h2>
		
		<h3>Task 1: Create an external CSS sheet</h3>
		<p>I downloaded the template provided on Moodle to start my work on CSS.</p>
		
		<h3>Task 2: Style your page</h3>
		<p>Playing around with different elements, I was able to create a cohesive, appealing look to the design of my webpage using CSS.</p>
