		<h2>IL activity: Review Professional Writing Characteristics</h2>
		
		<section id="task1IL">
		<h3>Task 1: Review professional writing characteristics</h3>
		<p>I read through the 14 professional writing characteristics on Moodle, keeping in mind how I will implement these into my own website.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="task2IL">
		<h3>Task 2: Evaluate resources</h3>
		<p>The website I am choosing to investivate is <a href="https://www.scriptbook.io/#!/">ScriptBook,</a> one of the AI softwares producers use to assess filmsâ€™ commercial viability.
		The webpage is extremely well done, so there was not to much for me to critique, but it provided me with lots of inspiration on how I can structure and write text for my own webpage.</p>
		<table class="center">
 			<tr> 
  		 		<td><b><center>Writing Characteristic</center></b></td>
				<td><b><center>Evaluation</center></b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr> 
    			<td>Accuracy</td>
    			<td>All the information provided on their product is backed by statistics, as well as reviews from major media/news sources.
    			Both of these give a more authoritative and trustworthy tone to the text.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Active Voice</td>
    			<td>An active voice is used throughout the website, demonstrating their confidence and engaging users.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Limit Biases</td>
    			<td>I am unable to find any biases/stereotypes on their webpage.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Clarity</td>
    			<td>While there is some technical terminology, it is suitable for the audience of this website, which consists of producers and filmmakers using AI software in the green-lighting and commercial viability process.
    			They have even included a <a href="https://www.scriptbook.io/#!/scriptbook/technology">Technology</a> page, defining concepts for users.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Conciseness</td>
    			<td>The webpage is not too wordy, especially not on the homepage. This is very important as users are only presented with a few key descriptions and images to keep their attention.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Conversational and Smoothly Flowing Prose</td>
    			<td>The text flows smoothly, but it could be more conversational. There are many locations where contractions could be used instead of "we are" or "we have."</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Correctness</td>
    			<td>It is evident that the group behind this webpage paid a high attention to detail. I cannot find any grammar mistakes.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Parallelism</td>
    			<td>I found one example of parallelism: "ScriptBook provides artificially intelligent script analysis, AI driven content validation & automated story generation." 
    			This sentence is located near the top of the homepage, quickly grabbing readers attention and keeping them hooked.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Positive Voice</td>
    			<td>I could not locate any downbeat words or words with a negative connotation. 
    			This positive voice is crucial, especially for an AI product in a field where people are hesitant towards embracing the technologies.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Strong Nouns and Verbs</td>
    			<td>Strong, specific verbs as well as nouns are used throughout this webpage. It's evident through the first words on the homepage: "Democratizing storytelling through the art of AI."</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Sentence Variety</td>
    			<td>There is quite a bit of sentence variety, and no two sentences feel the same. 
    			It's important to note that the sentence structure of the reviews on the homepage are similar; however, this feels intentional, emphasising the media's support of the software.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Simple Words</td>
    			<td>In places where more technical terminology could be used, the writing feels understandable even for less informed audiences.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Shorter Paragraphs</td>
    			<td>I was unable to find any paragraphs longer than 4-5 sentences, which is ideal for a webpage selling a product.</td>
  			</tr>
  			<tr> 
    			<td>Tone and Voice</td>
    			<td>The tone of ScriptBook is definitely more formal and informative, as they are providing information about their services.
    			An informal tone would make a service like this feel less trustworthy and reliable.</td>
  			</tr>

		<h3>Task 3: The AWE Writing process</h3>
		<p>Within the AWE writing process, the Assess step consists of defining an audience and purpose, conducting research, and organising, categorising, and outlining.
		At first, I think I struggled with defining an audience, as I thought anyone within the film industry would use my website. 
		However, I was able to narrow this down to people who feel as if their jobs might be affected by AI or are simply interested in the technologies, likely as a result of the SAG-AFTRA strikes.
		This then helped to inform my purpose, which is to increase public awareness of these tools, providing an overview on AI and its creative uses for an audience with less knowledge.
		One step I could improve on is conducting research.
		I want to learn more about the technical side of AI in order to write and discuss its uses and implications.
		It would be interesting to even talk to people within the industry to hear about their perspective on the issue.
		My portfolio is helping me to keep all of my information organised and in one location. It is definitely something I will continue to refer back to when developing my webpage next semester.</p>

		<h2>Lab activity: Adapting textual content to your design needs</h2>
		
		<section id="task1">
		<h3>Task 1: Using Voyant-tools to explore textual content</h3>
		<p>I decided to create a Voyant on the <a href="https://www.scriptbook.io/#!/">ScriptBook homepage.</a> Some of the results can be seen below.</p>
		<!--	Exported from Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org).
The iframe src attribute below uses a relative protocol to better function with both
http and https sites, but if you're embedding this into a local web page (file protocol)
you should add an explicit protocol (https if you're using voyant-tools.org, otherwise
it depends on this server.
Feel free to change the height and width values or other styling below: -->
		<center><iframe style='width: 477px; height: 363px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?corpus=dfc89ae174a357a4c23a8ab9aeb36537'></iframe>
		<iframe style='width: 477px; height: 363px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=scriptbook&query=read&query=ai&query=script&query=deepstory&mode=document&corpus=dfc89ae174a357a4c23a8ab9aeb36537'></iframe>
		<iframe style='width: 718px; height: 230px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Bubblelines/?query=greenlighting&docId=e0ab1dafafadb5f6a4c55d5b4e149319&corpus=dfc89ae174a357a4c23a8ab9aeb36537'></iframe></center>
		<p>I do think that this tool would be better used on an article containing a longer narrative/text; however, it is useful to see what terms are most prevalent on any webpage.
		As expected, the software's name is the most frequent word, as this is the product being promoted.
		I was suprised by the word 'read' being the second most-used in the text, and upon further investigation, I realised that it's because the website contains multiple 'read more' buttons.
		This is something I could definitely see myself implementing into my own homepage. 
		Instead of cluttering it with too much text, users have the option to view more information if they so desire.
		I think I prefer text analysis through the professional writing characteristics over Voyant, as I was able to really dive into the sentence structure, voice, and narrative of the website as a whole.
		Voyant helped me to see what terms are consistently being used for the product's branding, which could be useful when writing about different softwares or my own organisation.
		The professional writing characteristics, especially those like parallelism, could be combined with this to create the perfect sentences that will grab users' attention.</p>

		<h3>Task 2: Create Samples of text</h3>
		<ol>
  				<li>An informative paragraph on how AI softwares are being used in the green-lighting and commercial viability stages of films:
  				<p>Effective business decisions, box office success, and green-lighting scripts. 
  				Three steps in the filmmaking process you might not have realised are aided by Artificial Intelligence.
  				Producers use a variety of softwares, such as ScriptBook, Cinelytic, and Vault, to assess films' commercial viability.
  				These technologies can predict success based on factors like which actor to cast or how high to make a budget.
  				Although AI is not inherently creative, its ability to recognise patterns and structural elements of hit movies is crucial in the media business.
  				Next time you're at the cinema, remember that the film you're watching has probably been influenced by the power of AI.</p></li>
  				<li>A short introduction on actors protesting AI to grab readers' attention and provide context: 
  				<p>Is creativity being sacrificed for profit? Actors are feeling increasingly threatened by the presence of Artificial Intelligence in the film and TV industry.
  				Safeguards are being demanded as technologies replicate actors' likeness and replace background actors to save time and money.
  				People want to control how AI manipulates their image and receive fair compensation for its use.
  				As technology advances, creatives will continue to question the boundaries of AI use by studios.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Creating these write ups definitely felt more challenging than the type of formal essay writing I'm accustomed to. 
		Text on webpages should be easy to read, concise, and catch the readers' attention from the start.
		I tried out tactics from the professional writing characteristics, such as shorter paragraphs, parallelism (eg. "Effective business decisions, box office success, and green-lighting scripts"), clarity, and more.
		My audience has less knowledge about AI and its uses within the industry, so I did my best to make my text as clear and conversational as possible, while still being informative.
		I even showed my sample texts to friends of mine studying film, and they felt as if they were able to learn more about AI in just a few sentences. 
		After completing this task, I feel more prepared to create content, especially text content, for my own webpage.</p>
