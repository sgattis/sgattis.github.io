		<h1>Week 8 - Audio and Multimedia</h1>
		
		<h2>IL activity: Analysing Digital Audio</h2>
		
		<section id="task1IL">
		<h3>Task 1: Analyse the use of audio on the web</h3>
		<p>To evaluate the suitability of digital audio use, I explored content on the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/sound-audio/">Awwwards website.</a></p>
		<p>Example 1: <a href="https://www.supershine.design/">Supershine</a></p>
		<p>While the topic of this website is not necessarily relevant to AI and the film industry, I loved the use of audio so much I had to include it. 
		I think the combination of multimedia elements on this company's webpage is a great source to draw inspiration from.</p>

		<p>Audio criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What is the audio used for: sound effects, ambient sound, background music, speech?</b> The Supersine website makes ample use of audio from when you first enter the webpage to throughout.
			The page starts with speech saying, "Brighter days are ahead with unlimited design and dev." There is also the option to enter without sound and a transcript for accessibility.
			Once you enter the webpage, there is background music and ambient sound with button controls to turn it off or change the genre if you so choose.</li>
			<li><b>Can you find evidence of audio used with intent, which enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal?</b> All of the sound design is to support the branding of the website.
			The company's goal is to sell their "shiny" multimedia design and development products, and the upbeat music appeals to the user.
			My favourite music option is the one titled, "shiny," which sings the lyrics, "bring me the next shiny new thing," again, supporting the product and branding of the company.</li>
			<li><b>What advantages and caveats of audio use can you witness?</b> The audio design adds an extra element to the webpage, and it's something the user can have fun with and remember.
			However, I am not always the biggest fan of sound on websites. Sometimes it can annoy the user if they have their volume on or slow down a website. 
			One thing I love about the Supershine website is that is asks the user if they would like to proceed with audio before playing anything.</li>
			<li><b>How is audio combined with other media (images, text, video) in order to enhance a multimedia production?</b> The main type of media the audio is combined with is animation. 
			The sunshine and background "characters" dance along to the music as it plays. This gives a cohesive theme and look to the website.
			There is also text for the title and a slogan, as well as a quick sentence describing pricing of the product. All of these multimedia elements combine truly give users and idea of what the product is at first glance.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Week 2 criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>The audience:</b> It is easy to tell who the website is aimed at: organisations looking to purchase logos, website designs, etc. for their own company.
			It is interactive and offers places for users to get in touch and contact Supershine.</li>
			<li><b>Affordances, conceptual models and signifiers:</b> There is a combination of multimedia used for a seamless user experience. 
			Images, text, audio, and animation are used to showcase information about the product and how to purchase.</li>
			<li><b>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity:</b> Overall, the website does a good job with these elements, especially contrast and repetition. 
			At times, the text does feel a bit large, and, at the top of the homepage, some of the text disappears under the title, as it moves when your cursor does.</li>
			<li><b>Content Design:</b> The content is extremely relevant, as all the design decisions are clearly made with intent, supporting the branding of the company.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Example 2: <a href="https://www.netflixshadowandbone.com/">Netflix's Shadow & Bone</a></p>
		<p>Next up, I decided to explore some websites for TV and movie franchises to inspire my website. Although they are not about the topic of AI, the film and TV industry is at the center of my project.</p>

  			</div>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What is the audio used for: sound effects, ambient sound, background music, speech?</b> The audio is used for almost all of these purposes.
			Sound effects are used for buttons, games, and when you navigate to different areas of the screen. 
			There is also ambient sound from the fog moving around the page.
			Finally, there is background music to enhance the fantasy element of the show on the website.</li>
			<li><b>Can you find evidence of audio used with intent, which enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal?</b> Unlike Supershine, there is no speech stating a slogan; however, this website also uses audio elements to support branding and appeal.
			For example, the card games have "whooshing" sound effects to immerse the user. All of the audio really makes the user feel like they are inside of a fantasy world.</li>
			<li><b>What advantages and caveats of audio use can you witness?</b> Again, the audio design adds an extra element to the webpage, and it's something the user can have fun with and remember.
			However, I found some of the audio effects on this webpage to be quite annoying. If you hover your cursor over one of the 4 sections on the homepage, there is a shimmery, magic sound that does not stop. 
			I think if I were to implement sound effects in my project, I would refrain from using prolonged audio effects (unless it was background music) as to not annoy the user.</li>
			<li><b>How is audio combined with other media (images, text, video) in order to enhance a multimedia production?</b> One thing this webpage does excellently is combining audio with additional multimedia elements.
			Every button with text you click on has an unlocking sound effect. Glowing images have a shimmering sound effect. Whenever the fog animation moves, there is a sound effect to support it.
			This creates an immersive atmosphere, grabbing the user's attention and reflecting the tone of the show itself.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Week 2 criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>The audience:</b> I assuming the audience for this website is fans of the TV show, Shadow & Bone. 
			It is not a very informative website, rather, one with games and interactive elements for fans.</li>
			<li><b>Affordances, conceptual models and signifiers:</b> The webpage is fairly easy to navigate, but I don't love that you have to drag the screen around to explore rather than scroll.
			There is a combination of multimedia used signify different pages, and back buttons to return to the homepage.</li>
			<li><b>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity:</b> With a dark background, and lighter text (or vice versa on some pages), everything is contrasted well.
			All of the page's elements are consistent and support the theme/tone of the show.</li>
			<li><b>Content Design:</b> There is not much depth to the content, rather, it is just a fun way for fans to interact with elements from the show.</li>

		<h3>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of audio content</h3>
		<p>I selected two audio samples, one is a computer typing sound effect to use in my scriptwriting section and the other is background music that fits the tone of my webpage.
		These have been stored and written about in my <a href="mada-metadata_justification_table.xlsx">Metadata and Justification Table excel spreadsheet.</a></p>
		</section>
		
		<h2>Lab activity: Editing Digital Audio</h2>
		
		<h3>Task 1: Optimise your audio for Web use</h3>
		<p>Using Audacity, I trimmed my keyboard typing audio file and exported it in different formats, ensuring I used a consistent file naming structure.</p>
		
		<h3>Task 2: Exploring alternative options</h3>
		<p>Keyboard Typing Original File:</p>
		<audio controls>
  			<source src="master-files/bbc-computertyping-soundeffect.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
		</audio>
		<p>Trimmed, WAV (Microsoft) signed 16-bit PCM:</p>
		<audio controls>
			<source src="master-files/bbc-computertyping-soundeffect-edited-01.wav" type="audio/wav">
		</audio>
		<p>I converted the file to WAV format from MP3. While WAV files store more data, because I converted it from MP3, the full original signal quality was not regained.
		I do not see the value in using this file on my website, as it only takes up more space.
		Trimming the audio could be useful if I wanted to use this clip as a short sound effect on the scriptwriting page of my website.</p>
		<p>Trimmed, MP3 derivative in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Joint Stereo:</p>
		<audio controls>
			<source src="master-files/bbc-computertyping-soundeffect-edited-02.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
		</audio>
		<p>Trimmed, MP3 derivative in Standard (170-210 kbps) quality, Stereo:</p>
		<audio controls>
			<source src="master-files/bbc-computertyping-soundeffect-edited-03.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
		</audio>
		<p>I did not notice a different in the Standard vs. Medium kbps.</p>
		<p>Trimmed, MP3 derivative in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Forced export to mono:</p>
		<audio controls>
			<source src="master-files/bbc-computertyping-soundeffect-edited-04.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
		</audio>
		<p>The mono export definitely has less width and depth than the stereo. I personally prefer stereo, and I think I would use this type of export on my website audios.
		It felt less immersive and more flat than the original.</p>
		<p>Background Music Original File:</p>
		<audio controls>
  			<source src="master-files/fma-electronic-backgroundmusic.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
		</audio>
		<p>MP3 derivative in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Forced export to mono:</p>
		<audio controls>
			<source src="master-files/fma-electronic-backgroundmusic-edited-01.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
		</audio>
		<p>I wanted to try out mono again, but with a music file instead of a sound effect. I still would lean towards using stereo, as the user would feel more immersed.</p>
		<p>Higher gain, Trimmed, MP3 derivative in Medium (145-185 kbps) quality, Stereo:</p>
		<audio controls>
			<source src="master-files/fma-electronic-backgroundmusic-edited-02.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
		</audio>
		<p>Playing around with some different editing features, I increased the gain on the background music. This made the audio sound too loud and distorted.
		I will not be using this effect again, unless I have a quiet audio I need to increase the volume of.</p>
