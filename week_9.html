		<h1>Week 9 - Video and Multimedia</h1>
		
		<h2>IL activity: Analysing Digital Video</h2>
		
		<section id="task1IL">
		<h3>Task 1: Analyse the use of video on the web</h3>
		<p>To evaluate the suitability of digital video use, I explored content on the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/video/">Awwwards website.</a></p>
		<p>Example 1: <a href="https://www.plasticofilm.com/">Plastico Film</a></p>
		<p>First, I decided to look at a website for a film production company to see video use relevant to my topic.</p>
		<div class="row">
 			<div class="column">
  				  <img src="images/plasticofilm-videoheader.png" alt="screenshot of video header on plastico film" width="735" height="320">
  			</div>
 			<div class="column">
    				<img src="images/plasticofilm-videoexample.png" alt="screenshot of video example product on plastico film" width="535" height="320">
 			</div>
  			<div class="column">
    				<img src="images/plasticofilm-youtube.png" alt="screenshot of plastico film youtube cover image" width="735" height="320">
  			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Video criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What are the videos used for?</b> The videos on Plastico Film are used to showcase projects filmed and/or developed by the production company.</li>
			<li><b>Can you find evidence of video used with intent, which enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal?</b> As the goal of the website is to promote a film production company, 
			all of the videos truly seem to be used with intent. Not only do they have a video background for the homepage header (as many websites do), but videos can be seen throughout the website as videos are the product itself.
			These give users an idea of what kind of content the company films and the high-quality material appeals to anyone visiting the site.</li>
			<li><b>What benefits and caveats of video use can you witness?</b> In terms of caveats on my end, there appears to be some integration issues, as videos sometimes take a second to play or need to be clicked on/hovered over.
			I think I would find it better if the videos played automatically.
			Also, the header video felt a bit extreme (flashing lights, etc.) at some points and I was unable to pause it.
			As for benefits, the video content contributes to the aesthetic of the website and showcases completed projects. These videos are not necessarily trying to communicate relevant information
			in the context of the website, rather, they are displaying an art form.</li>
			<li><b>Is the length of videos suitable?</b> All of the videos are quite long, but I don't think it's an issue for this website. Users only need to watch a few seconds to get an idea of the kind of work this company does and can watch more if they so desire.</li>
			<li><b>How is video combined with other media (images, text, audio) in order to synthesise a multimedia production?</b> Once clicking on the videos, it takes the user to an embedded YouTube link.
			This is where multimedia elements are combined (eg. cover image, closed caption text, title cards, etc.), so users can gain a greater understanding into each project.
			As for the homepage, there are not many images, but there is text to support each video, explaining what each is about and the year it was created.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Week 2 criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>The audience:</b> The audience for this website is different brands and companies in need of video production products. There seems to be a focus on innovation and technology, such as AI (one reason I was excited to investigate this website).</li>
			<li><b>Affordances, conceptual models and signifiers:</b> The video portions of the website are fairly easy to navigate. However, I think they could benefit from underlining the text below the video to use as a hyperlink.
			I only realised the videos were linked to more information from playing around, but users quickly seeking out information should have a clear idea of where to go.</li>
			<li><b>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity:</b> This website does an amazing job at these elements. Everything is contrasted sufficiently and the videos can be clearly seen.</li>
			<li><b>Content Design:</b> The subject matter of the videos is extremely relevant to the website, again, as this is their product.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Example 2: <a href="https://openai.com/">Open AI</a></p>
		<p>Next, I decided to investigate a website promoting safe and wider use of AI.</p>
		<div class="row">
 			<div class="column">
  				  <img src="images/openai-videoheader.png" alt="screenshot of video header on open ai" width="735" height="320">
  			</div>
 			<div class="column">
    				<img src="images/openai-pausebutton.png" alt="screenshot of video pause button on openai" width="240" height="100">
 			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Video criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What are the videos used for?</b> This website does not seem to have many videos; the main one is the background of the title header.
			It includes clips of people talking, typing, using and/or creating AI products.</li>
			<li><b>Can you find evidence of video used with intent, which enhances information comprehension, retention and appeal?</b> Usually, when people think of AI, 
			they think of robots, advanced technology, etc. However, what I like about this video is that it feels absent of those notions and full of warmth and community.
			This would appeal more to users, especially those skeptical about the use of these technologies.</li>
			<li><b>What benefits and caveats of video use can you witness?</b> I don't see many caveats with this video, as it is mainly used for aesthetics and tone.
			As for benefits, again, it appeals to the user and enhances the values of the website, such as safety and human values.</li>
			<li><b>Is the length of videos suitable?</b> The video is short and loops, which is suitable, especially for a header. There is also a pause button available if users are not interested in watching the full length.</li>
			<li><b>How is video combined with other media (images, text, audio) in order to synthesise a multimedia production?</b> The video is used as a background to support the text, "Creating safe AGI that benefits all of humanity."
			As users scroll through the homepage, there are additional images with the same feel as the video with smiling people working together, making the website seem reliable and human-centered.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Week 2 criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>The audience:</b> The audience for this website is anyone looking to learn more about AI and research or potentially use the company's tools, like ChatGPT.</li>
			<li><b>Affordances, conceptual models and signifiers:</b> The video portion is extremely easy to navigate, as there is a pause and play button.</li>
			<li><b>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity:</b> A darker filter seems to have been put over the video, making the text in front of it stand out. 
			It aligns well with the rest of the page as well.</li>
			<li><b>Content Design:</b> The content of the video is not conveying much information, rather, appealing to the user and supporting the design of the homepage.</li>
		</ul>

		<section id="task2IL">
		<h3>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of video content</h3>
		<p>Both of the videos I decided to use have been put into my <a href="mada-metadata_justification_table.xlsx">Metadata and Justification Table excel spreadsheet.</a></p>
		</section>
		
		<h2>Lab activity: Editing Digital Video</h2>
		
		<h3>Task 1: Optimise your video for Web use</h3>
		<p>As I am using a Mac, I utilised the iMovie software to edit my video. I have a lot of experience editing video, so I am already familiar with the software.</p>
		<p>Low quality (resolution 540p, quality setting low):</p>
		<video controls>
			<source src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video-01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			<source src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video-01.webm" type="video/webm">
			<track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video.vtt" default>
		</video>
		<p>Medium quality (resolution 720p, quality setting medium):</p>
		<video controls>
			<source src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video-02.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			<source src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video-02.webm" type="video/webm">
			<track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video.vtt" default>
		</video>
		<p>High quality (resolution 720p, quality setting high):</p>
		<p>Note: Unfortunately, iMovie would not allow me to download at 1080p, as the quality of the source videos was not high enough.
		However, I still put the quality setting at high.</p>
		<video controls>
			<source src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video-03.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			<source src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video-03.webm" type="video/webm">
			<track label="English" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" src="master-files/scriptwritingAI-video.vtt" default>
		</video>
		<p>Using the audio and video clips sourced, I created a short intro video for the scriptwriting page of my website.
		I decided that instead of starting with a title card, I would first insert a video clip to grab the user's attention.
		I layered my background music and keyboard sound effects over the video, as well as put a filter to fit the aesthetic of my project.
		I will definitely be using medium or high quality settings when exporting my videos, as the low quality one was slightly blurry.
		Videos are a great way to combine multimedia elements and aid in information retention and website appeal.</p>
